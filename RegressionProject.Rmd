## Executive Summary  


## Exploratory Data Analysis  

```{r library, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
require(ggplot2) #import ggplot library
```
``` {r load, message=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
data(mtcars) #load mtcars data
str(mtcars) #checkout the variables in mtcars
data.frame(cars) <- subset(mtcars)
```
We can see that the following variables should be converted to factor variables for accuracy of our assessment:  
```{r factor, echo=TRUE}
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars2$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars2$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars2$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars2$am <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c('Automatic','Manual'))
```
Let's check the correlation matrix for to see what kind of relationship exists between the variables and *mpg*. We will square the result for easy comparison. We are using original *mtcars* data frame with numeric values to be able to use *cor* function.   
```{r correlation, echo=TRUE}
corCars <- cor(mtcars) #form correlation matrix
corCars[,1]^2 #display first row, squared
```
In our preliminary analysis, it looks like *mpg* is highly correlated with *cyl*, *disp*, *hp* and *wt* variables.  
Since we are asked to analyze the relationship between transmission and *mpg*, let's check that relationship with a boxplot:  
```{r box, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars2, col = (c("green","blue")), main="MPG vs Transmission", ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", xlab = "Transmission Type")
hist(stepDay$steps_by_day, main="Number of Steps Taken Each Day", xlab="Number of Steps per Day", ylab="Frequency", col = "red")
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
